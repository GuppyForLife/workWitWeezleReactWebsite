This is a portfolio showcase website for a videographer and artist known as WorkWitWeezle. The website is mobile responsive to all sizes with a responsive navigation. I used React.js and some React.js community libraries such as Reacstrap. The website is hosted on Netlify.

## My process

Using "create-react-app", I started with my focus on the Nav bar. It took me some time to format it exactly the way I wanted it, but I'm happy with the way it came out. The content for the site was given to me by the artist. However, the design was my own. I finished the homepage and moved on to the video page. The video page has two components to it (as does the photos and content page). The first component is to display the thumbnail and title of each piece of content in a grid format. The second component is to display the individual content for each media source i.e. "title", "video source", and "description". I seperated the media files into their respective categories in seperate JavaScript files to make the app more dynamic for future updates. After those were done, I created the contact page with a modal. The modal once submitted currently does nothing.
